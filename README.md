## 1. Introduction
Hi, my name's Minh Quan, I have a background in finance and economics as I'm a final-year at International Economics at Foreign Trade University, Campus II. I have develop a foundation of analytic skills and a keen interest on exploring and working with data through coursework and personal projects. <br />
Through out my studying journey, I have developed some particular skills such as business analysis, statistical analysis, data analysis which I believe can consolidate my foundation for being a data analyst. <br/>

## 2. Projects
This section includes several data analytics projects.

### China houses prices

**File:** [China houses price](https://github.com/Ulderrajd/Data-Analyst-portfolio/blob/41e7d7b1fc2b3e533fd4737fb21da86bbec0fb00/Power%20BI/China%20Houses%20Prices.pbix) <br />

**Description:** The main goal of the project is to determine house prices based on some criterias such as numbers of rooms, building type, near subway or not,... The analytic process involves perforimg exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between the house price per square meter (pricePerSM) and some factors such as numbers of room, house area,... The analysis also considers the house price by which district it locates. <br />

**Tools:** Power BI <br />

**Skills:** Data analysis, data visualization <br />

**Results:** The analysis reveals that house price depends on the building type, and whether it nears the subway or not. And also houses in districts which near the Beijing, namely distric 1, 7, 8, 10, tend to have higher pricePerSM, except for district 2. <br />

### Telco Customer Churn

**File:** [TelcoCustomer](https://github.com/Ulderrajd/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Python/TelcoCustomer.ipynb) <br/>

**Description:** This project aims to gain valuable insights from the dataset of customers of Telco, comprising information such as churn label (whether customer churned or not), churn reason (reason why the customer churn), and many other factors such as demographic, revenue earned from the customer and the service provided to the customer. Through these insights, company can adjust their service to retain its customer. Also, this project conducts a ML projection to predict potential churn customer. <br/>

**Tools:** Python (Google Colaboratory) <br/>

**Skills:** Data preparation (Loading and Cleaning), Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Features Engineering, Machine Learning <br/>

**Results:** From the EDA, there are some factors related to churned customers. For instance, churned customers tend to be older, their monthly payments are much larger but their Customer Lifetime Value is smaller compared to staying customers.Also, churned customers mostly use month-to-month contract. Furthermore, there is an offer program in which the number of churned customers is larger than staying ones. Regarding the machine learing, the classification model which predicts the churned customer works quite well, with 97.94% accuracy score, whereas the regression model cannot be used in predicting as its R-score is low. <br/>
